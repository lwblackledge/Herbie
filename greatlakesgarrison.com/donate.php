<h1>The Death Star Needs Your Help!</h1>

<img src="img/donate_deathstar.png" align="left" border=0>
As the 501st Legion and the Great Lakes Garrison continues to grow and traffic steadily rises, hosting costs are also on the rise.
<P>
For a long time, I was able to absorb the costs of the server because I manage my own personal Web sites, and 501st activities didn't draw too much from my resources at first.  The increasing popularity of the 501st Legion as well as our growing and advancing
professionalism is generating more traffic and activity, and that of course is using more available resources.
<P>
As such, please consider donating to the upkeep of the Garrison's Web server.  <span style="color: #ffcc00; font-weight: bold">Your donations go directly to paying the bills and <i>are not and cannot be used for
personal profit</i>.  I can't even see or touch the payments!</span>
Your donations to the hosting cost will also help expand available resources which means the potential for bigger, better, and more features as Web technology continues to grow.
<P>
The Empire (and I) thank you!
