<h2>Why a Snowflake?</h2>
<img src="img/glg_logo_100.png" align="left" style="padding: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" />One of the more common questions we've gotten since our founding in 2007 is "why the snowflake?"  The snowflake is just one aspect of the life and culture of the state of Michigan, that of a definitive winter; winters that often shape and define our character as Michiganders.
<P>
The snowflake is placed within a series of concentric circles which bear resemblance to a vehicle tire, another reference to Michigan's rich historic heritage as a pioneer of the automotive industry.  In combination, the snowflake can also serve a double-meaning as the hub and spokes of the wheel.
<P>
The blue colors represent the many lakes that define the landscape of Michigan.  In addition to the four of the Great Lakes which border Michigan, the state is also home to countless other lakes farther inland, as well as the smaller Lake St. Clair which connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie via the Detroit and St. Clair Rivers.
<P>
And of course, in the center of the snowflake is the insignia of the Galactic Empire, colloquially known as the Imperial cog.  The cog is an integral part of the Star Wars mythos as the symbolic representation of the Empire, and all of those childhood images of Darth Vader first boarding the Tantive IV in the original movie <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>.
