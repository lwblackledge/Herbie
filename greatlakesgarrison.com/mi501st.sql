These tumors can continue to grow all over his body and on his nerves. We are unable to biopsy any of his tumors at this time, and it is possible for them to turn in to cancer.

Tumors running along his nerves and carotid artery are visibly seen on the right side of his neck. Due to the tumor on the trigeminal nerve, every time when he chews food red flushing occurs on his right cheek that sometimes goes into his ear, eye lid and hairline. Sometimes when his skin flushes his right eye will water.\r\n          Putting pride aside, I need to ask for help.

That was the day, that I decided I wanted to join.  For the next half a year, I would show up to events and get Dylan\'s pics taken with all the troops\".\r\n\r\nRob\'s favorite events so far as a member have been the 2007 Thanksgiving Day Parade and various Motor City Comic Cons.

Bringing together a United Nations of Star Wars fans to spend an entire week preparing for such a public spectacle was among the greatest privileges he could have ever been honored to receive.\r\n\r\n\"While marching in the parade itself was the pinnacle of our hard work, it was definitely the camaraderie shared at the hotel bar, lounge, and out and about in the immediate surroundings just outside Hollywood with 501st members from around the world that made the experience truly worthwhile.\"\r\n\r\nRome started off with a TIE Pilot costume and joined Omega Wing. He hadn\'t given much thought to trooping while a member of Omega Wing, but since Omega Wing was -- at the time -- the premier destination for all things TIE pilot, a lot of members of Omega Wing were also concurrent members of the 501st.

And having served as the Legion Captain of the Guard for three years has taught me invaluable management skills -- both in terms of information and people -- that have been parlayed into my regular job.\"\r\n\r\nRome\'s nickname, \"Crimson\", started as a result of a music project he was involved in called Red Witch. Since he needed a user name when joining message boards and forums, he opted to use the analogous \"Crimson Warlock.\" Over time, typing all of that became tedious, so he just shortened it to \"Crimson\".\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to work, Rome is a computer tech for a public school district. He has fixed computers and readjusted people\'s thinking about computers professionally for 12 years. For the last two years, he\'s been responsible for the technology asset management for the district. In his own words, \"It\'s in this task that my management experience gained through the 501st have been handy\".\r\n\r\nOutside of the Legion, Rome likes to play bass guitar, dabble in bagpipes and build websites just for the fun of it. He recently redesigned and rebuilt the Web site of his local brewpub, along with a back-end database administration to run it all. Rome currently resides happily in Metro Detroit with his wife Lori and their dog Lucy.', 1),

When he was 4 or 5, he was bitten by the Star Wars costuming bug and dressed up like an Ewok for Halloween.\r\n\r\nJustin first heard about the 501st while building his Boba Fett costume. There were many people on The Dented Helmet that were talking abut the 501t, so he decided to check out what they were all about. He soon discovered that it was a group of people, \" joined together to bring the magic of Star Wars to so many for such a great cause\".\r\n\r\nSince joining, Justin\'s favorite events have been the Weird Al concert and trooping with Jeremy Bulloch in Grand Rapids for Make-A-Wish. He also says, \"Birthdays and weddings are always a blast. Parades are fun. Any event that involves kids in any way is always so much fun. Seeing the look in their eyes as they see Darth Vader and all the characters is the best.\"\r\n\r\nJustin\'s boardname (biomechanoid56) comes from the painting style of his favorite artist, HR Giger. In college, his ceramic work was influenced by Giger\'s bio-mechanical style of painting. Justin spent a lot of time studying his style, paintings and sculptures. This was also around the time Justin joined the 501st and the name was born.\r\n\r\nOutside of the 501st, Justin is a husband and a stay at home dad with his 2 year old son. He does work every Sunday at the Toledo Museum of Art in their family center, working with kids making different art projects each week. He is also working to be a freelance artist as well. Right now, Justin\'s hobbies include art (drawing, painting, sculpting), gardening (mostly carnivorous plant and voodoo lilies), and exotic pets as well. He still has 4 tarantulas, 2 mossy frogs, 1 fire belly toad, 1 axolotl and a bearded dragon.\r\n\r\nJustin has a bachelors degree in ceramics and Psychology as well as an Associates degree in Graphic Design. Some of his paintings and sculpture have taken second award at a local at show. One of his biggest accomplishments is that his 2 year old can name most of the major characters from the Trilogy.', 1),

He also remembers chewing the heads off of his brother\'s action figures when I was younger. To this day, Chris\'s brother still threatens to bite off the heads of some of his rarer figures. When he was 5, his mom listed in his baby book that his favorite book was Star Wars and he had a Star Wars cake. It\'s pretty safe to say that he was a fan at a young age.\r\n\r\nBeing a member of the 501st and Rebel Legions has given Chris the chance to make friends, some who are more like his family at this point. It\'s also given him an outlet for his constant need to tinker and make things. Being an active member in 2 Legions has also given him the chance to help out other members and potential recruits as the Republic Commando Advisor on CT.net. He sometimes gets some oddball questions here and there, but, \"it\'s really cool to have a hand in shaping the direction that the RC\'s will go within the 501st\".\r\n\r\nBack in 2002, \"Jaster\" went to a costume party in a $60 Jango costume from Rubies, complete with homemade cardboard jetpack and modified Rubies deluxe helmet. He knew that there had to be something better out there for the next year and found The Dented Helmet. He started working on an accurate Jango right after Halloween that year and later on, in the Fall of 2003, met Jay Shimko at Gibraltar Trade Center during a toy show and he gave Chris a Midwest Garrison business card. From there, he completed his costume, was approved and became BH3829.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris first needed any sort of screen name, he would usually use Jaster Mereel. When he first starting using it on Prodigy, the name was actually supposed to be Boba Fett\'s true identity. Later on, he used it for my name on the Midwest Garrison\'s boards and eventually it was shortened to Jaster.\r\n\r\n\"I think it was Shimko who started calling me Jaster in person. We were at an armor party or some sort of outing and there were too many Chris\'s at the party. He yelled over, \"Hey Jaster\" and the board name became the nickname.\"\r\n\r\nJaster\'s favorite events so far have been the Port Huron Icehawks events. In his own words...\r\n\r\n(I liked the events) \"not really so much for the game, but for the charity we were supporting during those events. My father was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis in 2000 and is currently receiving help from Council on Aging\'s Washington Life Center. Being able to help them out by participating in a 501st event was the easiest way I knew to return the favor\".\r\n\r\nOutside the 501st, Chris is an electrician working for a small company for the last 13 years in Shelby Township. His main specialty is troubleshooting and service work. He enjoys being around people and most of all fixing their electrical problems. Some of his other passions are cooking, playing the bass guitar, reading, karaoke and watching movies. Chris have been married to his wife Carolyn (SL 6156) for 15 years as of this October. He was a member of Mensa from 1991-1993, but let his membership go because \"it was boring\" and it looked good on college applications.

Sure Carl was a child and Vader was an inflatable punching bag, but it did not diminish the battle between good and evil. Perhaps this is why Carl joined the Rebel Legion as a Jedi prior to joining the 501st legion. But it did not take Carl long to be seduced to the dark side. “After I joined the Rebel Legion and came to my first troop, I was impressed with the armored Imperial characters and the fact that you could not see their faces made it appear even more fun.”\r\n\r\nBeing a part of the 501st has changed Carl’s life for the better. He has learned to be more outgoing and has become friends with others that he otherwise would have never known if not for Star Wars. He also really enjoys seeing the benefit of the Legions Charity work. “Helping out a good cause just makes you feel great.” Carl knows the fans appreciate what we do too. Seeing those awe-struck faces and the next generation of fans enjoying something he loved as a child is wonderful.\r\n\r\nSince joining in May of 2006, he has enjoyed many events, but Star Wars in Concert at the Palace of Auburn Hills has been his favorite.\r\n\r\nHis board name “Noslen L\'Rac” was created by himself and is simply his name spelled backwards.

Ever since then he thought it would be neat to have his very own TK digits.\r\n\r\nThat childhood dream finally happened in May of this year when Jesse was approved for membership with the 501st Legion as a Stormtrooper, and is now TK 4702 making him one of the newer members of the Great Lakes Garrison.\r\n\r\nJoining the 501st Legion has allowed Jesse to get more involved in the hands on building of Star Wars props and costumes in a way that he never imagined, and has since begun making his own custom made costume parts and accessories.\r\n\r\nWhen not in costume, Jesse is busy editing videos and producing motion graphics for a major chemical company in Midland, MI and has many years of experience in the creative/graphics industry.

(15, 501, 1, 2011, 'Well before the movies premiered in theaters, Doug\'s dad managed to get a comic book of Star Wars in 1976 and gave it to him for Christmas.  Being that he was only four years old and could barely read, he wasn\'t exactly able to follow the story.  He says, \"I thought the Empire was the good guys (they were the ones wearing white, after all), and Chewbacca was an evil monster.\"  It wasn\'t until he saw the movie half a year later that it all made sense.\r\n\r\nSpring forward to 1999 and Doug is reading comic book and comes across an ad for a convention called Star Wars Celebration.  He wanted to go, and why not since he had just purchased a Don Post TIE Pilot helmet and was looking for an excuse to make a complete TIE Pilot costume.  An event with thousands of people focused solely on Star Wars was certainly worth both the effort on the costume and the trip to Colorado.\r\n \r\nSo, with Black BDUs, medieval boots, gauntlets, homemade chest armor and chest box attached to the helmet with flexible metal hose, homemade patches, and a wrist communicator, he had his first Star Wars costume.  It all fit into his carry-on luggage and he was on my way to Colorado with his wife in tow.  \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at the convention, he donned the costume in public for the first time in the parking lot.  Doug says, \"Walking through that lot was so inspiring as kids and adults alike stared [open mouthed] and cried out in delight at the sight of me.\"  He posed for the first of many pictures for his new fans.  Such experiences were continuous over the next three days, and he was hooked on costuming.  But he was not member of the 501st, yet.\r\n \r\nIt was during the convention that he met up with members of the Swiss Garrison of the 501st Squad who showed up in force for Celebration.  It wasn\'t long before he had met nearly the entire 501st Squad – more than 20 Imperial costumers all together.  They explained to him how before an event they would coordinate amongst themselves trips to such events as conventions and always showed up in groups to achieve a spectacular presence.  He very much wanted to be a part of that.  \"Any time I was hanging out with at least a few of these 501st members, we\'d be ‘trapped\' for a half-hour or more while crowds of people took photographs and I loved every second of it,\" says Doug.  As soon as he got home, Doug sent in a picture of himself from the convention and became an approved member of the club, making him the first official member from the state of Michigan.  The club was growing rapidly following Celebration and already was totaling more than 30 members.  However, the closest members to him were a handful of troopers in Chicago and another small group in Toronto, so he did a lot of traveling those first few years to various events.  Within a few months the club had grown to more than a hundred members and the name was changed to the 501st Legion.\r\n \r\nWhile Doug has trooped many different events, Celebration II is probably his favorite event overall.  \"Any event that is entirely Star Wars themed is up at the top, and with 501st members acting as staff and security for the vastly overwhelmed convention organizers. We added a level of immersion in the Star Wars universe I had never seen before or since,\" says Doug.\r\n \r\nDoug is also recognized by his designation or Legion Member ID of TK-501, but just how did he obtain one of the coolest designations within the Legion?  \"Back when I joined, the preferred way of determining your member ID number was with your birthday.  So, when [501st Legion founder] Albin Johnson approved my membership photo, he gave me a call and asked what my ID number should be. I replied, ‘Well, as my birthday is on May 1st, I\'d like the designation 501.\'  He laughed and said ‘So you\'re the trooper who finally takes that one!\'”\r\n \r\nWhen not in costume, Doug is a computer programmer who designs data acquisition and process control software for engineering applications.\r\n \r\nDoug\'s hobbies outside of the 501st include live-action role play (LARP), steampunk costuming and his very own Star Wars online comic.  He is involved in multiple fantasy LARPs and a future LARP based on the Firefly series.  His love of costuming extends here where he has made a number of detailed costumes for the various characters he portrays.  He is working on a near-future mercenary LARP making use of Airsoft weapons.  Doug started a steampunk costume last year, and has been to one steampunk event so far.  He also draws a Star Wars online comic called Dewback Wing based on an online role play board he has been a part of since around the time he joined the 501st.  Check it out!  Shameless plug:  http://td501.comicgenesis.com/\r\n\r\nBeing a member of the Legion has affected Doug in many positive ways. He traveled a lot in those early years when the 501st Legion was in its infancy and it seemed like every event occurred in some other state.  He traveled to Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburg, Toronto, Montreal, Greensboro, Atlanta, Orlando, Columbus, and many other locations that he would otherwise not have seen.  Along the way, he met a lot of great people and made great friends at every event.

While in the process of building the Fett he learned about the 501st while attending a prop party. There he met a few members of what was then the Michigan Squad and they told him about the Legion and that is what pushed him to join. He never did finish the Boba Fett costume, but ended up joining the Legion as 501st Clonetrooper.\r\n\r\nSince joining the Legion in 2006, Michael has served as the Garrison Membership Liaison from 2008 through 2009 and as the Commanding Officer for the 2009 – 2010 term.

Out of all the movies we watched, Star Wars really stuck out from the rest because it held something magical and special for him.\r\n\r\n\"The characters were so unique and spectacular that you wished that you lived in that world\", says Matt. He was fascinated by light sabers and would dream that some how, some day he could have his own real working light saber and become a Jedi Knight.\r\nThat changed when his family bought The Empire Strikes Back. \"It changed my whole outlook on Star Wars\" says Matt. \"That\'s where we first meet Boba Fett and right then and there I fell to the Dark Side. I knew that some day I would have to build a Fett costume\".\r\n\r\nA few years later that came to fruition when he came across a Boba Fett costume on eBay. It needed some work but he had to have it. It wasn\'t until after he started modifying the costume that he heard about the 501st Legion and everything that they stand for. Matt says, \"I was really attracted to the fact that the 501st raises so much money for charity. I made it my goal over the course of the next year or so to make my Boba Fett 501st Legion approved so that I would be able to troop with fellow Star Wars enthusiasts, and share the joy of the Star Wars universe\".\r\n\r\nFor Matt, becoming a member of the 501st Legion has been a great experience. \"I have been able to meet new people who share my same passion for building movie accurate costumes and playing \"adult dress-up\". However, Matt feels the best part of being in the club is the looks on all the kids\' faces and how much they absolutely love seeing their heroes magically transported from the screen to real life.\r\n\r\nOne of Matt\'s favorite missions was the Build-A-Bear Star Wars release at Rivertown Mall in Grandville. \"The people in the mall were so surprised to see us in Star Wars costumes and it was rather enjoyable watching everyone\'s reactions, both children and adults alike\", says Matt.\r\nCould you imagine if you went to the mall when you were a child and there were characters from your favorite movie just hanging out? It would be better than seeing Santa and the Easter bunny put together.\r\n\r\nWhen Matt is not hunting down a smuggler for a bounty, one might be surprised to find out that he is a professional brewer for Founders Brewing Co. in Grand Rapids where he has worked since January 2007. \"I have always had a love for craft beer and enjoyed home brewing for many years in college. I was fortunate enough to know the right people who led me to the opportunity to work at Founders. It has been the best job I have ever had and cannot see myself ever leaving the beer industry. I love every aspect of my job even though at times it can be very physically and mentally demanding, but I take it one pint at a time\", says Matt.\r\n\r\nMatt creativity and love for build things does not stop at creating movie accurate costumes; he also loves to work with wood and has built his own Baroque stringed instrument called a Viola da Gamba (it\'s like a cello but with six strings and tied on frets) and plays Baroque music with the Early Music Ensemble at GVSU. Matt explains that Baroque stringed instruments have gut strings instead of metal, and are played very differently than their modern cousins. \"It takes quite a bit of discipline but in the end the sound is well worth it\". Matt also plays the Violone del Contrabasso which is the Baroque version of the modern String Bass. \"It has been a great experience sharing music with people performed on period instruments and using historically informed practices\", says Matt.', 1),

Mike has trooped in a lot of really fun events such as being on stage with Sugarland or Weird Al Yankovic in front of thousands of their fans but he says those type of events never compare to the one smile you can create by visiting a sick child in a hospital bed.”\r\n\r\nMike’s earliest Star Wars memory takes him back to when he was a kid. His mom worked at a local drug store. “Back then, they used to put trading cards in loaves of Wonder Bread. One day my mom brought home the entire set. The movie wasn\'t even released yet and while looking at the cards I saw a Stormtrooper for the first time!” He remembers it like it was yesterday. Shortly after seeing the movie, Mike’s dad came home with a bunch of Star Wars figures that he had purchased at Kmart. “I remember we opened them and stood them up on the table while tossing the packaging into the garbage. Who knew that they would be worth hundreds of dollars in the box? Nobody knew the impact that Star Wars would have on the world”. As a hobby Mike still collects Star Wars memorabilia and has a pretty extensive collection. His collection has expanded to building what he cannot buy – as Mike and his brother Jerry are building their very own R2D2 droid.\r\n\r\nSince joining the 501st Legion, Mike’s life has been very busy. “In one short year, I visited schools, hospitals, concerts, fundraisers, and hockey games just to name a few. Mike says, “All of the time I spent laying around doing nothing is gone. All of that wasted time now has a meaningful purpose.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mike is not imposing the will of the galactic empire, he operates a carpet cleaning, repair, and inspection service company. Before that, he served our country for 10 years in the Navy’s Submarine Force. He and his wife Kristie have raised two kids, Nic and Heather, who are both currently in college. He enjoys spending time with his wife and friends.', 1);

The film had a lasting impact on young Dave as later in life he would build his own Boba Fett costume and would eventually lead him to join the 501st Legion.\r\n\r\n\"While building my Boba Fett costume, I heard about the 501st Legion from other Boba Fetts of The Dented Helmet, an online discussion forum and information archive to help fans build high quality replica Fett costumes,\" says Dave.\r\n\r\nHe finished his Boba just in time for the fall 2005 Motor City Comic Con and it was here that he met members of what was then the Michigan Squad.\r\n\r\n\"Their costumes were great and everyone was super nice. I had thought about joining the 501st Legion while building my suit, but was not really sure if it was for me. Well, once I met the group at MCCC, saw the display table (small by today\'s standards), and had experienced costuming, I was hooked.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent in his application and trooped his first official event a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nSince then, Dave has trooped almost 100 events! When asked if he has a favorite, he replies, \"it\'s really hard to say. Big or small, high profile or low, charity or promotion, convention or formal, each one holds a great memory for me, just for what it was.\r\n\r\n\"The 501st Legion has changed my life. I went from being a casual observer of the Star Wars universe to an active participant.\"\r\n\r\nDave no longer watched, collected or played with Boba Fett; he WAS Boba Fett! With that new level of fandom came some very cool and unexpected opportunities.\r\n\r\nDave can be found on the Great Lakes Garrison forum as Gator Fett. When asked about the origin of his nickname, Dave says, \"Gator is a nickname derived from my last name. Gates ... Gateser ... Gator. Get it?\"\r\n\r\nHis dad was Gator to his friends, and his grandfather was too. \"I was never called a Gator until my sophomore year in high school, when one of the seniors on the swim team made the connection and started calling me Gator,\" says Dave. He added the \"Fett\" when he needed a board name on The Dented Helmet and Gator was taken by someone in Florida.\r\n\r\nWhen Dave is not collecting bounties on rebel scum, he works for Chrysler at the Tech Center in Auburn Hills. He has not had a chance suit up recently as he was promoted this past April to a new position as a Facilities Engineering Manager in the Advanced Manufacturing Powertrain Division.\r\n\r\nDave has three daughters and they keep him and his wife pretty busy and occupied with all the hobbies they are getting into these days, but he still finds time to enjoy SCUBA diving, home improvements, and he has started on a few costuming projects not related to Star Wars.\r\n\r\nOther accomplishments outside of the 501st that Dave is most proud of are his family, career, obtaining an MBA and being a registered Professional Engineer.', 1),
(24, 8789, 11, 2011, 'Dave has always loved Star Wars from the moment he saw it on the big screen when he was a young boy. He was eight years old and his father came home from work one day and said that he wanted to take him to a movie that everyone at his work has been talking about. He said the title of the movie was \"Star Wars\", which at the time held little meaning for Dave, but when they went to see it on the big screen…\"WOW\", says Dave, \"my life was changed forever!\"\r\n\r\nSince that day he\'s been an avid collector of all sorts of Star Wars merchandise and memorabilia. \"I regularly go to Comic Cons, toy shows, and collector shows to hopefully one day come across that one particular Star Wars item I didn\'t know was out there, and to complete my existing collections\", says Dave. This passion in part is what led to him joining the ranks of the 501st.\r\n\r\n\"I was at a toy show and there were members of the 501st Legion present as well as Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett)\", says Dave. \"The 501st guys were having a drawing to raffle off all sorts of vintage Star Wars merchandise so I bought a significant number of tickets. All the proceeds went to the Make-A- Wish foundation. I didn\'t win, but my friend actually did and he was so happy when a member of the 501st Legion contacted him to inform him that he was the winner\", says Dave. At the time of the delivery, his friend asked about how to become a member of such a cool and awesome club. His friend then contacted Dave with the information, and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nSince joining the club in 2007, Dave has trooped almost 60 events! When asked if he has a favorite event that stands out, he says, \"I have many events I find are very enjoyable and fun to troop such as the Grand Rapids Griffins and the West Michigan Whitecaps games. These are two of my favorite events primarily because I get to troop with so many of our members at the same time. It\'s like one big costume party and we\'re all the stars of the evening.\" However, if Dave had to pick his most favorite event, it would have to be the Grandville Michigan 4th of the July Parade. \"Although very HOT & STICKY, it is my favorite, primarily because we get to interact with so many people and children in one place and to hear them scream out my character\'s name, touch so many of their hands, and get the hugs really does it for me\", says Dave.\r\n\r\nBecoming an official member of the 501st Legion has allowed Dave to better understand and have a greater appreciation for the fact that people are so fortunate in life not to be stricken with an illness, or born with a handicap. Dave says, \"We troop events to help raise money for people who are less fortunate than we are and how truly lucky I am to have been given a gift of good health. You really take for granted certain things in life and by being a member I guess I really wouldn\'t have fully understood this.\"\r\n\r\nDave\'s nickname and forum name is PESCI. The name actually was given to him by one of the Great Lakes Garrison members. \"I guess I resemble the actor Joe Pesci. I am shorter in height and on some occasions may mimic his tone of voice. I am also Italian and perhaps elicit somewhat of the same mannerisms, and body language he may have, so I guess in some ways the name is somewhat fitting\", says Dave.\r\nHis love for Star Wars and collecting has resulted in him meeting quite a few Star Wars celebrities like Billy Dee Williams, Jeremy Bulloch, Peter Meyhew, David Prowse, Carrie Fisher, Jake Loyd, Tamara Morrison, Anthony Forest, Richard LePalmentie, and Felix Silva to name a few!\r\n\r\nWhen Dave is not on patrol for the Empire, he works as a Plastics Process Engineer for a global manufacturer of automotive components - primarily head lamps and tail lamps - for many Toyota, GM, Mitsubishi, and VW automobiles. He has earned a degree in Plastics Engineering Technology through Ferris State University, and also receiving his certification as a Master Molder through RJG associates. He likes to ride motorcycles, loves to build and renovate property (especially his own). He enjoys weight lifting, swimming, camping, bike riding, rollerblading or anything that can be done outdoors. Dave says, \"I\'m also a master on the Grill!\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked what his biggest accomplishment is Dave replies, \"The birth of my daughter Celia who just turned 14 months. I hope that one day she too will also enjoy Star Wars as much as I do.\"', 1),

He had not seen the movie yet but it was the toys that caught his attention, especially the action figures. They were really cool, he thought as a kid. It was not until late in the school year of \'78 that he saw Star Wars for the first time on what was a weekend field trip of sorts organized by his 4th grade teacher who most have been a big fan of the film. Parents and children met at their school and car pooled to Toledo to see the movie at what was then the Greenwood Mall. He was hooked. \"To see your toys come to life on the big screen and find out who was who was just amazing\", says Jerry.\r\n\r\nSince then, Jerry has been a Star Wars fan boy. \"Looking back I can say that the movies really had an impact on me. I remember drawing, pictures in art class from elementary all the way through high school of scenes from the movies and characters, I dressed up like a Jawa one year for Halloween after I talked my grandma into sewing me a costume. The costume was a little big on me but that worked out because the next year I used that same costume to dress up as a Jedi. I wasted tons of money on toys, trading cards, and Star Wars arcade games and collectibles\", says Jerry.\r\n\r\nOne year he came across an old dusty Don Post Vader Helmet in an antique shop and picked it up right before Halloween. Turned out to come in handy as he and his wife Gina (DZ-9377) dress up for a Halloween party that year as Darth Waiter and Princess Tray-a. \"We had a blast. Gina had the Leia wig, white dress, order pad, and a \"tray\" that a waitress would carry around and I had a white shirt, black pants, Star Wars tie, order pad and apron. It was a lot of fun\", says Jerry.\r\n\r\nJerry has always loved Star Wars and dressed up as a character here and there, as a kid or as a gag, but that all changed on January 1st, 2007. I could not believe my eyes, says Jerry. \"There were hundreds of Stormtroopers marching in the New Years Day Rose Parade, it was amazing\". Turns out, it was the 501st Legion. Jerry started doing some research on the group and six months later he too was a member and for his second event he walked with the 501st Legion, Midwest Garrison, Michigan Squad in the Americas Thanksgiving Day Parade right here in Detroit.\r\n\r\nSince joining, Jerry has trooped over 80 events from birthday parties, Comic Cons, to School Fund raisers to performing on stage with Weird Al Yankovic four times, but when asked what his favorite event has been he says Celebration V. It was during this event that he was one of nine stormtroopers that were used to introduce television personality and host of The Daily Show Jon Stewart for the interview he conducted with Mr. George Lucas. \"It was truly amazing to participate in that event\", says Jerry. \"After the interview Mr. Lucas stopped by to say hello to us, we got to spend a few moments with him and got to take a couple photos. I was very lucky to meet him and he was very enjoyable\".\r\n\r\nJerry has three Legion approved Star Wars costumes. A Stormtrooper, Tusken Raider, and he was the first approved Rum Sleg in the Legion. Rum Sleg is a bounty hunter from Episode 1. When asked if he is planning another costume, Jerry says, \"Well, I think all members of our group are always thinking about what their next costume is going to be and in some cases it is not Star Wars, but for me it would have to be a Snowtrooper. It is Michigan after all!\"\r\n\r\nBeing a member of the 501st Legion has become a family affair for Jerry and his family. His wife Gina recently joined the legion as an official member as a female tusken raider and his son Zane has a tusken child costume and his daughter Elora has a Jawa costume. \"We get to dress up as a family and have tons of fun with other members of the garrison whose wives and children participate too. It is always fun\".\r\n\r\nWhen Jerry is not imposing the will of the empire, he works as a Labor Relations Representative in automotive manufacturing.

He still recalls going to the theatre to see the Empire Strikes Back on the big screen when it was on its Re-Mastered release. \"It was the first time I saw a Star Wars film on the big screen and I was blown away. The shear mass I felt when I saw the AT-AT thundering along and shooting down Rebel speeders was jaw dropping. It quickly became my favorite episode\", says Zachary.\r\n\r\nHe originally got a set of armor just to have a suit to show off but it later developed into wanting to be a member of the 501st Legion. \"The whole \"joining something greater than yourself\" came to me when I started researching the 501st Legion and I always wanted to do more volunteer work\", says Zackary.\r\n\r\n\"The Legion has been one of the most rewarding things I\'ve ever done.

The most diverse event had to be Detroit Maker Faire last year, although I was out trooping in 95F heat!

To think the only thing that I ever seen that I could even try to make a relation to was Star Trek, and honestly, it didn’t compare!” Sitting in the theatre at the edge of his seat, eyes wide open to witness the collapse of the Death Star and watching the final credits roll, he couldn’t believe what he just saw. After Star Wars finished playing, Rob’s brother asked him if he wanted to stay to watch the next movie, which was Alien. He told Rob that it was just like Star Wars, and Rob thought to himself, “If Star Wars is this good; I can’t wait to see the next show, Alien!” As he sat and watched Alien he wondered where the gold robots, light sabers and blaster guns were. He sat in the car bored to pieces, and it wasn’t until he saw the chest buster exploding from John Hurt’s chest as he lay on the floor of his brothers’ car, balled up in a fetal position crying, saying, “This isn’t anything, like Star Wars!” After seeing Star Wars for the first time, he begged his mother to take him to K-Mart to buy the toys, and his mother bought him the only three figures they had left on the shelves, which were C-3PO, R2D2 and the Storm trooper. That day he brought a little piece of a galaxy far, far away home with him.  That day was the start of Rob\'s fascination with Star Wars. \r\n\r\nYears later, attending the Motor City Comic Convention in Novi, Michigan Rob found himself speaking to several members of the 501st Legion. He was amazed with the quality and realism of the costumes that each member wore, he began inquiring about how their costumes were constructed, and he picked up a brochure to learn more about what the organization is, and what they stand for. He wanted to join the Legion with a Zuckuss Costume.  As being an artist working with clay, he began the sculpting process for the Zuckuss head and he soon realized how much work would be going into making a costume for Zuckuss. Long time friend, Jerry Russell who was already a member of the Garrison, suggested that Rob create a Tusken Raider costume, as he was making one too. Rob mulled over the suggestion for a few months, and decided to scrap the idea for Zuckuss, and make a Tusken Raider.\r\nThe main reason Rob joined the 501st Legion is very near and dear to his heart. Rob has a young daughter who was born with two congenital heart defects, and Down syndrome. The first time Rob and his family met costumers from the Rebel Legion at a National Down Syndrome Society Buddy Walk, and his daughter, Riley was amazed with the Jedi’s light sabers, and she laughed and gave them countless hugs, and to see her smile, alongside of all the other children and their families at that walk. \"The vision of those families enjoying themselves alongside professional costumers, and seeing how happy it made everyone was larger than life, and this inspired me to want to make a costume of my own and to be a part of something that made a difference in the life of a child\", says Rob.\r\n\r\nSince joining the group in May of 2010 Rob has attended over 40 events.  When asked what his favorite event was since he joined, Rob states, “I enjoy trooping the NDSS Buddy Walks. To have my daughter hold my hand while I’m in costume is such a thrill! A lot of people get a kick out of seeing her walking beside me. She’s so tiny compared to me! Even though she’s just a small little girl, it’s amazing how she helps the other children not be afraid to come up to a character and say hello or to get their picture taken. It’s a good feeling to have my daughter as my #1 fan!”\r\n\r\nRob states, “The 501st has changed my life in many ways. First, it has brought some amazing people into my life. I’ve made some new friends who I have so much in common with. It got me out of my artist’s slump. It’s helped bring my family closer together, as both of my son’s troop alongside me in their own costumes on many events. More importantly, it has helped me teach my children as well as other people the importance of helping others, and donating your time, not judging a person and if you have the opportunity to make a difference in another person’s life, even if it is putting a smile on someone’s face, you should do it.”\r\n\r\nRob\'s forum name is Tubby Tusken.  How he got that nick name is an interesting story to say the least. \"I began as Bloodfreak68 on the boards because of my love of horror movies that name just seemed to fit me at the time, and I used that name for everything at that time on other forums I belonged to.  I can remember trying on my costume for my submission picture and my middle son saying, “Aren’t you a little TUBBY to be a TUSKEN RAIDER?” I felt like Homer Simpson, and I wanted to grab him by the throat and say “Why you little …!” However, after he said that, I began laughing so hard and I thought to myself well, when your right, your right\", says Rob.  \r\nHe trooped later on with Rebel Legion member Chris Blackstock (Lumpy) and told him the story and he said, “Why don’t you change your name to Tubby Tusken?” After hearing him say it, and laughing together about it he knew it was meant to be.\r\n\r\nWhen Rob is not riding his Bantha for the Empire, he works as a collision repairman at his family owned collision shop.  \"I take care of cars boo boo’s by placing band aids on them. Big band aids. When a car is in an accident, I get the cars fixed up so they look like they’ve never been wrecked. It sounds like a fun job... but it’s not.  Sanding cars all day is like constantly swatting flies. It NEVER ends. Working at our shop is like an episode of American Chopper and I’m Mikey. My brother and my dad are at each other’s throats every day. Several friends have told us that we should have a reality TV show titled, “American Body Shop.” Unfortunately, we’d more than likely be shut down by the FCC after the pilot was viewed! It’s NOT what I want to do, but it pays the bills for now. I’m a few credits shy of getting my degree in Graphic Design\", says Rob.\r\n\r\nRob also enjoys sculpting with clay. He enjoys creating special effects and make up for independent films. He also loves to draw, airbrush, painting, and geocaching with his family. He also enjoys to cook, and is the equipment technology specialist for Paranormal Research and Investigation of Southeastern Michigan. (P.R.I.S.M.)\r\n\r\nWhen asked about what his greatest accomplishment is he replies, \"Being a husband to a fantastic wife, who has put up with my costume building in the middle of our living room for many years, and being a father to amazing sons, and a daughter who is one of a kind.\" \r\nHis other accomplishments include being the owner of Malefactor Studios EFX, and he was awarded “Best Special Effects” at the Detroit International Independent Film Festival. He was named 2nd place winner for sculpture design and concept in 1996 at Wonderfest in Louisville, Kentucky. \r\nHis sculpture work has been shown on the nationally syndicated television program, “Strange Universe”. His sculptures have been featured online at Gremlins in the Garage, and several times in Amazing Figure Modeler, Images, and Fangoria Magazines.\r\n', 1),
(33, 3824, 8, 2012, 'Scott was eight years old when Star Wars was released. He really doesn\'t remember the hype about going to the show.  “I do remember that my brother and I got some action figures (R2-D2, Chewbacca, Ben and Darth Vader) from our grandmother.  Who knew that collection would still be growing after 35 years”, says Scott.\r\n  \r\nLightspeed a few years forward and Scott went to a Red Wings Alumni hockey game in Fraser and the 501st were there.  “I asked about the costumes and what they were all about and I was hooked. You’re telling me I can dress up like that all year, not just Halloween? I\'m in!” Scott says.  After joining the group in January of 2009 he then found out about all the great work the 501st Legion does for charities and the community.  Scott says, “This gave the costuming a focus and created a goal”.  He thinks that everyone else that does this would agree, seeing the looks on the kids’ faces is priceless!\r\n\r\nScott has trooped over 30 events since joining the club.  When asked if he has a favorite event he says it is hard to pick.  “I would say it would be between the Weird Al concert at the Fox Theater and Star Wars Night at Commerica Park. The Fox Theater is such a cool place. Back stage, the walls are covered with the signatures of the bands and comedians that have played there. It is a completely different perspective looking out from the stage. Star Wars Night with the Tigers was also incredible. I got to be on top of the dugout for the 7th inning stretch! Getting up and down was a huge challenge in a Stormtrooper costume, but it was way worth it! Someone got a great photo of me with the scoreboard in the background. You sometimes see it on the Tours of Duty page”.\r\n \r\nJoining the Legion has changed Scott’s life.  “I think being in the group has brought out my creativity and stoked my passion for art”, he says.  Scott has always loved to draw, paint and sculpt.  “After I got out of school I think I lost some of that passion but when I joined the 501st I had to put together my costume which involved forming plastic, painting and some sewing and my creative passion was reborn”.  While attending the Motor City Comic Con Scott visited the artist section.  “I would think I can do that, I just need to apply myself”, says Scott.  He has been sketching again and is very happy doing it. He also created the new logo for Shadow Squadron (The Great Lakes Base Rebel pilots group) and a patch for the Star Wars Night at Commerica Park.\r\n   \r\nWhen Scott is not keeping an eye out for Jedi, he works as a graphic designer in the sign business for which he has been doing for the last 22 years.  He currently works at the Rochester Sign Shop in Rochester.  Scott says, “It\'s a lot of fun. I am always working on something different. We just did the new Viper Plant sign for the Connor plant. It is pretty neat driving around and actually seeing your work”!\r\n\r\nScott also is a collector (understatement). He mostly collects Star Wars items and sports memorabilia, but he will pick up anything that catches his eye.  “I need to finish my basement so I have somewhere to display some of the items”, says Scott.  He also likes camping and scuba.\r\n\r\nScott is married to his lovely wife Tracy and they twin 6 year olds Alex & MacKenzie.  Scott says, “They are all very supportive of everything I do. The kids love Star Wars and Tracy is even working on a couple of costumes”.  \r\n', 1),
(34, 8430, 10, 2012, 'Joel’s earliest memory of Star Wars takes him back to when he saw \"A New Hope\" in the movie theater when he was about 5 or 6 years old, or maybe it was playing with all the action figures in his back yard.  “I had Luke and Darth Vader with the lightsabers in the arms and the cloth cloaks....Unfortunately, they all crashed in the Millenium Falcon and were never heard from again (I buried them and still haven’t found where at)”, says Joel.\r\n\r\nJoel’s inspiration to join the 501st Legion came when he attended Celebration III in Indianapolis.  He started building his first costume (with a little help from the FanForce.net’s costuming forum) and when he arrived at Celebration that year he saw all the cool costumes and was hooked.\r\n\r\nHe joined the Legion in August of 2009 and has trooped almost twenty events.  When ask what event has been his favorite, Joes replied, “I have had so many great experiences at events, but my two favorite events are the Grand Rapids Griffins and West Michigan White Caps Star Wars events.   I have attended every one of them so far and don\'t plan on missing any in the future”. \r\n\r\nBeing in the 501st has changed my life, explains Joel.  “When I tell people that I am a big Star Wars fan, I usually get the \"oh, you’re one of those people\" look.  Once they see the costume and her about all the great things we do as a group, they usually get excited.  The best thing about being in the group is how excited the little (and big) kids get when they see us in costume. That means so much to me.”  \r\n\r\nWhen Joel isn’t hunting down a hidden Rebel base for the Empire, he works for a large egg producer, maintaining coops.  “If you live east of the Mississippi river, you have probably eaten eggs from our farm”, says Joel.\r\n\r\nJoel also enjoys reading.  He has a very large Star Wars book collection for which he reads all the time.  “I am always waiting for the next Star Wars book to come out”, says Joel.  He also enjoys working on cars, target shooting, and hanging with my family. \r\n\r\nJoel is currently attending college to earn a degree in Business.  Joel explains, “With a full-time job and college, it takes up most of my time, but I know it will be worth it in the end”.\r\n', 1);
